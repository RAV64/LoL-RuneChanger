# LoL RuneChanger
Automatic League of Legends rune changer

Setup:
- Download [Zip file](https://github.com/RAV64/LoL-RuneChanger/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
- Extract zip file content.
- Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Download [Geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases). (On windows place exe file with other file content) on mac I suggest using [brew](https://brew.sh/) and running "brew install geckodriver")
- Navigate to file content in cmd/terminal. (type cd in console, drag & drop folder -> enter)
- (Next to steps might need you to use "pip3", "python3" or "py")
- run "pip install -r requirements.txt" 
- run "python main.py" or "py main.py" (This is the only step when using this again in the future)
